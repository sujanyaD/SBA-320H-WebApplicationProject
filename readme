Explanations of the technologies used: 
1.used Google Api for searching books https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=${query}&key=AIzaSyCJbUF_JRiOk9R6abyiAZ3QddT6TQ_LAO0 by using ID and checkBooks
2. used React Framework for Front End And External REST Api's to Fetch my Data 
3. Used CSS for Styling and HTMl for UI

Explanations of the approach taken:
1. used useEffect to communicate with dom and fetch data from API.
2. used simple Search Query to perform my book search and fetch data .
3. used getSearch for search query and to set it to current value of search
4. used checkbooks function to check searh based on id.
5. used search book component validate search input before triggering search by u sing if condition.
6.used event handlers like on click and on change.
7. used Conditional Rendering (ternary operator) to check if book exists by using accesstokenlink key to access value stored in PDF.
8.used Slice to limit the display of books
9.  used Iframe element to display book conentent to read online instead of directing book or link to google library . 
10. scope of improvement in this code: could have used more react hooks, like usereducer to access through arrays and couls use more feature and event handlers for doing more actions like more filtered searches . 
11.Could have used UseReducer for Searching through books for more easy search format. by using actions and payload.
